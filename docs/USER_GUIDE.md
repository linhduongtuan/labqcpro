# User Guide

This guide helps users get started with the labqcpro project: quick setup, how to run demos and realtime monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## Quickstart (macOS)
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (if not already present):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the demo to generate example outputs:

```bash
python lab_qc_demo.py --input data/example.csv --output results/
```

5. Open outputs (on macOS):

```bash
open results/
```

## Realtime monitor
To start the realtime monitor (desktop or service):

```bash
# start the service version
python start_realtime_monitor.py

# or run the desktop monitor
python realtime_qc_desktop.py
```

See `REALTIME_QUICK_START.md` and `REALTIME_MONITORING_GUIDE.md` for environment setup and sample data sources.

## Where outputs are written
- By default demos and analysis write to `results/`.
- If the repository is configured to ignore `results/`, see `.gitignore` — this repo tracks `results/` explicitly.

## Troubleshooting
- Missing packages: ensure your venv is activated and `pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeds.
- Permission errors when writing `results/`: verify you have write permissions in the repo folder.
- If the realtime monitor can't connect to a data source: check network access and data source configuration files.

## How to contribute docs
- Edit `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` to add function-level details and CLI parameter lists.
- Edit `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` to add platform-specific instructions or troubleshooting tips.
