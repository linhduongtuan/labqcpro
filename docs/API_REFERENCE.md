# API Reference

This file documents the public CLI entry points, scripts, and important modules in the repository. It is intended as a concise reference for developers and automation.

## Overview
Project: labqcpro
Location: repository root
Purpose: Laboratory QC analysis and realtime monitoring tools. Many modules are provided as CLI scripts.

## CLI entry points / scripts
The following scripts are entry points you can run from the project root (activate the venv first):

- `lab_qc_demo.py`
  - Purpose: Run a demonstration analysis that generates example plots under `results/`.
  - Usage example:
    ```bash
    python lab_qc_demo.py --input data/example_input.csv --output results/
    ```

- `lab_qc_analysis.py`
  - Purpose: Core analysis routines for QC metrics.
  - Typical usage: imported by demos or run in other automation scripts.

- `realtime_qc_monitor.py` / `realtime_qc_desktop.py`
  - Purpose: Realtime monitoring components for streaming or desktop monitoring.
  - Usage: See `README.md` and `REALTIME_QUICK_START.md` for setup and run instructions.

- `start_realtime_monitor.py`
  - Purpose: Convenience script to start the realtime monitoring service.

- `validate_fix.py`
  - Purpose: Utilities to validate fixes applied to QC routines.

- `test_dual_monitor.py`
  - Purpose: Test harness for the dual-monitor functionality.

## Important modules (high-level)
- `lab_qc_analysis.py` — analysis functions, statistical calculations, charts.
- `lab_qc_demo.py` — demo runner that calls analysis and writes outputs to `results/`.
- `realtime_qc_monitor.py` — monitors data in realtime and raises alerts/updates.
- `realtime_qc_desktop.py` — GUI/desktop variant of the realtime monitor.
- `quick_reference.py` — short commands and reference examples.

## Input / Output conventions
- Input datasets are typically CSV files in `data/` (see `data/` for examples).
- Outputs are written to `results/` by the demo scripts and analysis routines.

## Examples
Run the demo and open the generated results:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python lab_qc_demo.py --input data/example.csv --output results/
ls -la results/
open results/demo_sigma_chart.png    # macOS: open the image
```

## Contribution notes
Add new CLI scripts to this file with a short description and a usage example.
